# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories. It utilizes the PlantVillage dataset and is built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Data Source**: Kaggle - [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- **Model**: Custom CNN built from scratch using Keras
- **Classes**: 38 plant disease categories
- **Goal**: Automatically identify plant diseases from leaf images to support agricultural diagnosis.

## 📌 Features

- CNN-based image classification
- Image augmentation for improved generalization
- Training-validation split for evaluation
- Visualizations of model performance (accuracy/loss)
- Prediction support on custom images

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)
- Kaggle API
